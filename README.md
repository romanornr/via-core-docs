# Via L2: A Bitcoin L2 EVM-compatible Modular Sovereign ZK‚ÄëRollup

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Via

## Simple intro to Via 

Via is a Bitcoin Layer 2 Modular Sovereign ZK-Rollup that combines zero-knowledge proofs, zkEVM, Bitcoin's PoW security, and Celestia data availability layer by adopting a modular approach without compromises.

Our zkEVM enables developers to write, test, deploy, or migrate existing smart contracts, using a framework and developer tools they're already familiar with, by using our SDK.

Celestia acts as our data availability layer, stores each batch's calldata and zk-proofs with scalable throughput and verifiability.

Our Verifier Network ingests the data, validates every proof, and finalizes batches before periodically anchoring a compact state root to the Bitcoin blockchain.

By anchoring our rollup's state root into Bitcoin, Via inherits Bitcoin's finality guarantees and Proof-of-Work security without bloating Bitcoin's UTXO set or incurring massive fees every batch.

Via operates as a modular sovereign rollup, meaning it retains full autonomy over off-chain execution and on-chain validation.Unlike monolithic blockchains, where the rollup is integrated into the base layer, sovereign rollups decouple execution from consensus and settlement.

This modular design allows us to innovate and evolve independently. Because execution data, data availability, and settlement are separated, each layer can evolve at its own pace. Unlike traditional rollups, where users may be forced to exit a compromised chain, sovereign rollups, such as Via, allow the network to reject invalid state transitions altogether.

In the event of a faulty execution due to malicious behavior, honest nodes can coordinate a fork, preserving network integrity without relying on a fallback Layer 1 withdrawal mechanism. This gives our sovereign rollup strong autonomy, fault recovery, and resistance.

Until very recently, there weren't many credible options to denominate gas fees in hard assets like BTC. Ethereum isn't built for that. Solana doesn't support that.

Most blockchains are not modular or flexible enough to decouple execution from fee logic.
Via, with its modular architecture and Bitcoin as a settlement layer, can charge BTC for gas fees and accumulate a meaningful reserve. Most L1s and other rollups can't.

### How does Via L2 work?

Via is a modular sovereign, validity-proof zk-rollup for Bitcoin with a zkEVM execution layer that scales throughput without introducing new L1 programmability or custodial trust. 

It relies on Bitcoin-native primitives: Taproot for key aggregation, inscriptions/OP_RETURN to record state commitments and governance messages, and a MuSig2 threshold bridge for BTC withdrawals. 

For each L2 batch, Via posts a single 32-byte state root to Bitcoin along with a pointer to the batch data on the data-availability layer. A zero-knowledge validity proof is produced off-chain that anyone can verify.

The proof is succinct, small and fast to verify with cost independent of batch size, so Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain role remains minimal to durable commitments and governance while execution happens off-chain at high throughput and low cost.

Data availability is separated from settlement. Full batch data is made available on Celestia (DA), while Bitcoin serves as the commitment and settlement anchor where L2 state roots and governance actions are periodically recorded.

A distributed verifier network independently validates ZK proofs against the data posted to Celestia and only recognizes batches whose commitments and proofs are consistent. Inscriptions function as state commitment posts and governance instructions, not as an L1 consensus mechanism, allowing Via to build on Bitcoin for securing durable commitments and reorg-bounded finality without embedding complex logic on-chain.

Security and trust assumptions are explicit. L2 correctness relies on the soundness of the validity proofs and on data availability from Celestia; clients can verify proofs and sample DA independently. Economic finality of the posted commitments inherits Bitcoin‚Äôs reorg resistance once inscriptions confirm.

The BTC bridge is trust-minimized via [MuSig2](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261): withdrawals require a threshold of keys that are governed on-chain (via governance inscriptions) and operationally constrained to sign only for finalized, proven exits. 

This approach avoids merged mining and is secured by Bitcoin by anchoring zk-verified batch roots and governance messages on L1, minimizing on-chain footprint, and achieving low fees and high throughput through off-chain execution and data, with validity proofs ensuring correctness.

Via's design minimizes Bitcoin's on-chain footprint by committing only batch roots and governance updates, keeping costs low while avoiding miner dependencies, while delivering full EVM programmability and targeting throughput and cost efficiency well beyond Ethereum L1, all while maintaining Bitcoin‚Äëlevel settlement guarantees and end‚Äëuser verifiability.

## How Via L2 Works: Batch Lifecycle and Anchoring

For each L2 batch, Via posts a single 32-byte state root to Bitcoin along with a pointer to the batch data on the data-availability layer. A zero-knowledge validity proof is produced off-chain that anyone can verify. The proof is succinct, small and fast to verify with cost independent of batch size. So Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain role remains limited to durable commitments and governance while execution happens off-chain at high throughput and low cost.

Celestia provides data availability, while Bitcoin serves as the commitment and settlement anchor, where state roots and governance actions are periodically recorded. A distributed verifier network, along with end users, fetches batch data from Celestia, verifies the ZK proof against the posted state root, and only accepts batches that match the commitments and proofs. In this setup, inscriptions are authenticated posts for state commitments and governance activities (such as system wallet updates), rather than an L1 validity consensus mechanism. This separation allows Via to anchor to Bitcoin for reorg-bounded finality and censorship resistance, without embedding complex logic on-chain.

Security and trust assumptions are explicit. L2 correctness depends on the soundness of the validity proofs and the availability of batch data on Celestia; clients can verify proofs and independently sample or audit DA. Once inscriptions confirm, the economic finality of posted commitments inherits Bitcoin‚Äôs reorg resistance.

BTC custody is secured through a MuSig2 threshold signer set, with keys and policies defined by on-chain inscriptions. This ensures that custody rules are transparent, auditable, and upgradeable without trusting any single party. Operators are cryptographically constrained to sign only for finalized, validity-proven exits, which eliminates arbitrary withdrawals and protects user funds.

Via is a sovereign rollup anchored by commitments. Via is not AuxPoW, merged mining, or a sidechain like Rootstock, Botanix Spiderchain, or Tether Plasma XPL. Sidechains depend on external guardian or validator sets, often using rotating threshold multisigs, which do not enforce state correctness or withdrawals in their L1 checkpoints.

In contrast to these sidechains, Via's custody and exits are enforced by posted commitments and ZK validity proofs, with a MuSig2 threshold signer set bound by on‚Äëchain policies.

## Why Choose Via?

Via is a Bitcoin L2: an EVM-compatible, modular sovereign ZK rollup anchored to Bitcoin for settlement and using Celestia for data availability. It delivers EVM programmability on a Bitcoin‚Äëanchored stack without adopting Ethereum‚Äôs consensus, security assumptions, or token economics.

### üõ°Ô∏è Advantages over Ethereum

**Anchored to Bitcoin‚Äôs PoW**
- Via periodically commits state roots to Bitcoin, deriving settlement assurances from the most battle-tested PoW network
- Avoids Ethereum‚Äôs Proof-of-Stake dynamics and validator slashing risks

**Decentralization & Censorship Resistance**
- Benefits from Bitcoin‚Äôs miner diversity and neutral, apolitical base layer
- No exposure to Ethereum validator policies or staking concentration

**Store-of-Value Base**
- Built around Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed-supply monetary foundation
- Fee economics are BTC-denominated rather than tied to ETH

**BTC Gas by Default**
- Users pay gas in Bitcoin (an L2-native/bridged representation), so no separate gas token is required
- Reduces friction and avoids multi-token operational risk

### ‚ö° Advantages over Other Bitcoin ‚ÄúL2s‚Äù

**Validity-Proved Finality**
- ZK proofs + verifier attestations provide fast, provable finality without 7-day fraud windows
- Withdrawals finalize once proofs are verified (no fraud-challenge waiting game)

**Reduced Game-Theory Assumptions**
- No challengers/watchtowers; security rests on proof correctness and the verifier set
- Eliminates reliance on economic incentives that can be gamed

**Verifier-Network Security**
- Threshold attestation by multiple independent verifiers; no single operator can finalize alone
- Permissioned at launch with a path to greater decentralization

**Bitcoin-Native Anchoring, EVM Execution**
- Account-based zkEVM for apps and tooling; Taproot anchoring/inscription support on Bitcoin
- Purpose-built integration for Bitcoin settlement rather than adapting an Ethereum rollup

**Scalable Data Availability**
- Celestia provides horizontal DA scaling, avoiding Bitcoin block-space bottlenecks
- Efficient batching and compression for throughput

### üöÄ Unique Value Propositions

**Best of Both Worlds**
- Bitcoin settlement assurances + full EVM compatibility (MetaMask, Hardhat, Remix, etc.)
- Seamless migration of existing dApps with access to BTC liquidity

**Future-Proof Modular Architecture**
- Execution, DA, and settlement evolve independently (faster provers, DA upgrades, conservative Bitcoin base layer)

**BTC-Denominated Economics**
- Protocol revenue accrues in BTC, avoiding perpetual sell-pressure on VIA
- Enables strategic buybacks/revenue-sharing without reflexive tokenomics

**Developer- and Institution-Friendly**
- Familiar Ethereum tooling; clear separation of concerns can simplify risk and compliance reviews

*Terminology & accuracy notes*: Via is a **sovereign** rollup that anchors compact state roots to Bitcoin and uses **Celestia** for DA; it does **not** post full transaction data to Bitcoin. ‚ÄúImmediate‚Äù finality depends on prover/attestation latency and anchoring cadence. Gas is paid in **BTC on Via** (a bridged/L2-native representation).

Via doesn't just offer another Layer 2 solution. It represents a fundamental advancement in how we scale Bitcoin while preserving its core principles of security, decentralization, and censorship resistance.
